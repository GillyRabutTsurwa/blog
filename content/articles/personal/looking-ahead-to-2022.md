## What's a New Year?
I've been to once New Year's Eve Party so in my life. it was a concert with my girlfriend at the time: shitty music, festive atmosphere, the countdown, the New Year's kiss, whispers of optimism of the upcoming year, confetti, balloons, you name it. It all felt fake, but in such a moment, it's damn near impossible to take time to reflect and analyse things. The motto of the show, was go with the flow. 
Skipping to the end, it ended up being a disappointing year. The hopeful words said on the eve of the New Year proved to be shallow and cheap and by mid February 2019, myself, just like the most of us, were behaving and operating no differently than we were in October 2018. The New Year bounce was quickly dissipated and it was back to normal.

## What *Actually* was 2020?
The following year was the one that makes me regret not going to a New Year's Eve party. I can only imagine. The year 2020 was supposed to be scenes: 2020, a new decade, the symmetry of the number making it good to look at and say, all these things that could make some gassed about the year. I can but assume that people were even more hyped about going into 2020 than going into 2019. I'm certain of it. It only took 9 weeks for the pandemic to stiffle the country and dampen (more like obliterate) people's spirits.
Needless to say, 2020 was an extraordinary year; for me, it is the most **insane** year I've lived through. From the beginning stages of the pandemic in March-April to the nationwide riots that ensued throughout June as a result of the George Floyd incident in Minnesota, (where I was living at the time) the year was a hectic one. I have never envisioned what a dystopia would actually look like, but after the events that took place that year, (and going on well into the next one) it isn't impossible to see how such a society **might** come about. 2020 streched many people very thin. If there was ever a year that "taking things day by day" needed to be emphasised, it was this year. 

## What's Coming
Fast forward to the end of 2021, which to me, has been 2020 - part 2 and I can't help but think that 2022 will play along like 2020 - part 3. In fact, I am sure of it. Overall, I think it is going to be a very difficult year. Personally, however, I will have a breakthrough year. There is obviously a catch: to stay disciplined. The dismal start to the decade will continue, but two years in going into the third, there are no excuses. That being said, people will struggle mentally, especially those who don't have a reliable circle or community. Also, those who are afraid of making their own decisions will have a torrid time. This is because life will make decisions for them instead, and some of those decisions will be too hard for them to take.

## Final Thoughts
I've always thought of the New Year as the most overrated of holidays, because we make more of it than what it really is, a new year. Watching the ball drop, gathering for parties, the countdown, etc; that's all cool, and they don't overcompensate the occasion. But it's when we start proclaiming brash statements like "new year, new me", "my New Year's resolution is", and "fresh start" -- just to list a few -- where it's revealed how fickle-minded we really are. If you think that's harsh, talk to the people who had the resolution of doing gym but fall out before February even arrives. 
Resolutions don't have to be made in the New Year, you can decide to work on your being at any day of the year, and fresh starts aren't cemented for the first of January, but people like to romantisise and sensationalise everything they can. It's the way of the modern world and I understand that.
Anyways, if you're reading this post not long from its release date, a Happy New Year to you. Though I think 2022 will be a shitty year, I hope that this is not so, for you, fellow reader.
