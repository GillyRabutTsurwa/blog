## Packing Your Things and Leaving
You may have thought that for my first post, I would explain the purpose of my blog site, give you some sort of onboarding to get you acclimated. A warm welcome. But odds are this is not the first blogging site you have encountered, so forget all that. I am going straight in.
I'm use to packing and moving a lot. I've done this many a times throughout my life. But I have never done it on my own. I was always aware that the world was huge, with many places to explore and settle at. But I never really believed that much of it was accessible to me. So when the opportunity came to move halfway across the country, I didn't think twice. People are so vastly different. You have some people who travel (or at least have the desire to travel) as if the world is not big enough for them, whereas you have other than are born, raised and have died without drifting from a 50km radius of their hometown. 

## Struggling to Adapt
Not for one day do I regret leaving behind my family and friends to navigate life on my own for the very first time. As a matter of fact, I don't think moving across the country was very difficult at all. I know many who've traversed acrossed the ocean(s) and have had to deal with bigger issues such as higher degrees of culture shocks, language barriers, possibilities of getting taken advantage of, discrimination; the list goes on and on. But I never considered -- perhaps underestimated -- the difficulties that I would face moving to a new place all by myself. It was hard; Nothing too overwhelming, but it was damn difficult. Unsurprisingly, I got exposed in many areas of my life. People like to talk about *"I'm doing me"* and *"I'm working on myself"*; all that rubbish, only for down the line, to be in a no better, or yet, even worse condition than they were before. The truth that many people ignore, is that *"I'm growing as a person"* cannot happen unless you get exposed. The best case scenario is that you expose yourself and fix up before the world does. And the worst case scenario, you ask? That would be the world exposing you in the open, and all the bullshit that comes with that. But anyways, I digress. Here's what I learnt (I'll share my top 3 lessons).

### Responsibility
I am not as responsible as I thought I was. If external pressures have any significance in my life, they definitely did in this area. This is the first time in my life where I am not responsible for anyone, nor is anyone responsible for me. When you are on your own, being responsible takes a lot of discipline and consistency; motivation is not enough to get you by. When it comes to the body, assuming responsibility (for some) and acting on it is easy, all one has to do is look at the mirror. But when it comes to matters of character, behaviours and habits, what does one do? Speaking of habits...

### Habits
This one is an easy one: good habits, if not maintained, will be **naturally** replaced with bad ones. It takes a lot to build, but not much -- and at times nothing at all -- to destroy. Practising good habits routinely is very important to maintaining mental sharpness and making one's life easier.

### Alone Time
The term "self love" gets thrown around a lot, to the point where I now despise it. We've have abused that term to the point where we use it whilst doing things that cause irreparable damages to our lives. I have discovered the ones who use this term to describe and justify what they are doing in their lives are the ones who care too much what people think, have a massive fear of rejection, and cannot stand being alone. Spending time alone serves a very important purpose: this is when character is built. Mia Hamm, legendary USA footballer once said: 

*Character is who you are when nobody is watching*. 

Absolutely. Athletes don't get better during gameday. They get better during training and showcase their progress during gameday. It's the same principle. And just like there are some people who can't bear the thought of rigorous training, a lot of us can't fathom spending productive and important time alone.

## Momentum
Now that I'm an adult, it is clear to me that most of us needlessly make life unecessarily harder for ourselves. I don't know if this is a result of petiness, stubborness, or stupidity. Too often I see people sabotage themselves whenever they are on a roll. All that time building a routine, exercising discipline and self control, just to throw it away for the dumbest of reasons. It is a mentality that expresses: *If it's not broken, break it and complain that it is broken*. I often see that we do too much when little to nothing is needed to be done, whereas when something is needed to be done, we do nothing at all. What I can say, momentum is heavily underestimated at best and ignored at worst.

## Road Trip Settings
My favourite part of leaving to go somewhere new is the journey. All the cool things there are to do and see in between. This is especially the case with road trips. I've taken more road trips than I can count, and even though it is temporary, there is something very liberating about leaving somewhere, and doing your own thing in a random place before finally getting where you need to go. Maybe it's the impermanence, or maybe it's something as simple as rolling my windows down and blasting music while traversing on endless highway. Anyways, thank you for coming to my TedTalk. More to come.

Chao.
